      <p>
        ESP-NOW MIDI is a wireless MIDI protocol built on Espressif’s ESP-NOW
        technology, specifically designed to enable reliable, low-latency
        communication between ESP32-based devices. An LGPL-licensed Arduino
        library is available on GitHub to support straightforward integration
        into custom hardware and software projects. The library can also be
        installed directly via the Arduino Library Manager.
      </p>
      <p>
        The API closely follows the design of the standard Arduino MIDI library,
        which allows existing MIDI applications to be adapted with minimal
        modification. Bi-directional communication is fully supported, enabling
        devices to both transmit and receive MIDI messages. In addition, the
        library includes a comprehensive set of example sketches that
        demonstrate common use cases and accelerate the development process.
